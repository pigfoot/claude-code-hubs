# Slide Deck & Presentation Styles

Prompt templates for creating professional presentation slides, infographics, and slide deck content using Gemini image generation.

> **⚠️ CRITICAL - NotebookLM Branding Protection**:
>
> **DO NOT include NotebookLM brand/logo/name in generated slide decks!**
>
> **How to use NotebookLM style correctly:**
> 1. When user specifies `style: "notebooklm"` → **YES, apply the visual aesthetic**
> 2. Apply these NotebookLM-inspired characteristics (see lines 586-593 in SKILL.md):
>    - Polished, well-structured tech infographic aesthetic
>    - Clean slide-level organization with logical flow
>    - Professional but accessible design
>    - Minimal text, maximum visual communication
> 3. **CRITICAL**: When writing the Gemini prompt → **NEVER mention "NotebookLM"**:
>    - ✅ Write: "clean professional presentation aesthetic", "modern tech infographic style", "polished slide design with Google-style documentation aesthetic"
>    - ❌ **NEVER write**: "NotebookLM", "NotebookLM style", "NotebookLM aesthetic", "NotebookLM logo", "NotebookLM brand"
>    - ❌ **NEVER include**: NotebookLM logos, branding, watermarks, or trademarks in the generated images
>
> **Why**: Using "NotebookLM" in prompts may cause Gemini to generate Google's NotebookLM branding/logos, which:
> - Violates trademark/brand usage policies
> - Creates misleading content (your slides are not official NotebookLM content)
> - May trigger brand protection filters
>
> **Summary**: `notebooklm` is a style **trigger** for Claude (use the aesthetic!), but **translate to descriptive terms** in the Gemini prompt. Never include NotebookLM branding in the output.

**Important**: All slide deck styles automatically use **lossless WebP** format (VP8L encoding):
- Saves 20-30% file size compared to PNG (typical for diagrams/slides)
- Perfect for slides with text, icons, and graphics
- Completely lossless (zero quality degradation)
- Much better than lossy formats (lossy WebP saves 95% but blurs text)
- This is automatically applied when using `style: trend` or `style: notebooklm`

Move the title to the center.
Add more visual emphasis to section 2.
Make the text neon blue.
```

### Content Grounding

## Usage Tips

1. **Specify aspect ratio**: Use `16:9` for slides, `4:3` for traditional presentations, `1:1` for social media
2. **Include text explicitly**: Write exact titles and labels in the prompt
3. **Reference real data**: Provide actual numbers, percentages, or content when available
4. **Iterate strategically**: Make small adjustments rather than full regeneration
5. **Use natural language**: Describe what you want conversationally, not as keyword tags
6. **File format**: Slide deck styles automatically use lossless WebP (VP8L) - no need to specify format, it's optimized for your content type

## Multi-Slide Generation

When generating multiple slides for a presentation, use the **Hybrid Mode**: Plan → Parallel Generation → Review.

### Phase 1: Planning

Before generating, plan the entire deck:

**1. Define overall theme and style**
- Choose visual style (Professional, Blackboard, Data Viz, etc.)
- Lock down color palette (specific hex codes)
- Set consistent layout format (16:9, 4:3)

**2. Create content outline**
```
Slide 1: Title - "Presentation Title"
Slide 2: Overview - 3 key points
Slide 3: Details - Deep dive on point 1
Slide 4: Data - Charts and metrics
Slide 5: Conclusion - Summary and CTA
```

**3. Pre-plan output directories**
```
001-title-slide/
002-overview/
003-details/
004-data-viz/
005-conclusion/
```

### Phase 2: Parallel Generation (using Task agents)

For **3+ slides**, use Task agents for parallel generation:

```
# Dispatch multiple agents simultaneously (single message, multiple Task calls)
Task("Generate slide 1: Title slide, style: trend, colors: #d71920...")
Task("Generate slide 2: Overview, style: trend, colors: #d71920...")
Task("Generate slide 3: Details, style: trend, colors: #d71920...")
// All run in parallel
```

**Critical - Pass identical style specification to each agent:**
- Same colors, fonts, layout
- Same `use_lossless = True` for consistency
- Same aspect ratio and image size
- Same visual style reference

### Phase 3: Review & Adjust

After parallel generation:

1. **Visual review** - Compare all slides side by side
2. **Consistency check** - Do colors, fonts, icon styles match?
3. **Sequential fixes** - Regenerate any inconsistent slides one by one

### When to Use Each Approach

| Slides | Approach | Reason |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1-2 | Sequential | Faster, no coordination overhead |
| 3-5 | Parallel | Speed benefit outweighs coordination cost |
| 6+ | Parallel (batches of 3-5) | Split into manageable batches |

### Example Prompt for Parallel Generation

```
Generate a 5-slide presentation deck about "Cloud Security Best Practices".

Style: trend (Trend Micro brand + professional aesthetic)
Format: 16:9, lossless WebP
Color lock:
- Trend Red #d71920 (primary/accent)
- Dark Blue #005295 (secondary)
- Gray #333333 (background)
- White #ffffff (text)

Slides:
1. Title: "Cloud Security Best Practices 2025"
   - Large title centered
   - Subtitle: "Protecting Your Infrastructure"
   - Minimal design with shield icon

2. Overview: "5 Key Practices"
   - Hub-spoke layout
   - 5 practices radiating from center

3. Identity: "IAM and Zero Trust"
   - Icons + 3-4 bullet points per section
   - Split layout (left: IAM, right: Zero Trust)

4. Data Protection: "Encryption Metrics"
   - Bar chart showing encryption adoption
   - 3 key statistics with percentage callouts

5. Summary: "Action Items"
   - Numbered list (1-5)
   - Each with icon and brief description
   - Footer CTA

Use parallel Task agents to generate all 5 slides simultaneously.
After generation, review consistency and adjust if needed.
```

### Example 2: Professional Editorial Style (NotebookLM-Inspired Aesthetic)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: This example shows how to use `style: notebooklm` trigger WITHOUT including NotebookLM branding in the output.

```
Generate a 5-slide presentation deck about "AI Product Development Best Practices".

Style specification for Claude: notebooklm
⚠️ CRITICAL: When writing the Gemini prompt below, translate to descriptive terms:
- DO NOT include "NotebookLM" in the prompt sent to Gemini
- DO NOT generate NotebookLM logos, branding, or watermarks
- Use descriptive style terms instead (see below)
Format: 16:9, lossless WebP
Color palette:
- Deep blue #0a2463 (primary/headers)
- Teal #2cafa4 (accent/icons)
- Coral #ff6b6b (highlights/callouts)
- Light gray #f5f5f5 (background)
- White #ffffff (cards/text boxes)

Visual characteristics (descriptive terms for Gemini prompt):
- "Clean professional presentation aesthetic with polished tech infographic style"
- "Modern documentation visual design similar to Google's product guides"
- "Well-structured slide-level organization with logical information flow"
- "Professional but accessible design with clear visual hierarchy"
- "Minimal text, maximum visual communication using icons and simple illustrations"
- ⚠️ DO NOT mention "NotebookLM" anywhere in the prompt sent to Gemini

Slides:
1. Title: "AI Product Development"
   - Large centered title
   - Subtitle: "Best Practices for 2025"
   - Simple AI icon or abstract geometric pattern
   - Clean white background

2. Overview: "5 Core Principles"
   - Hub-spoke layout with AI icon at center
   - 5 principles radiating outward:
     * User-Centric Design
     * Data Quality
     * Ethical AI
     * Iterative Testing
     * Continuous Learning

3. User-Centric: "Designing for Humans"
   - Split layout (left: problem, right: solution)
   - 3 key points with icons
   - Real-world example callout box

4. Metrics: "Measuring AI Success"
   - Bento grid layout (2x2)
   - 4 metrics with large numbers and trend arrows
   - Clean data visualization style

5. Action Plan: "Getting Started"
   - Numbered steps (1-4) in vertical flow
   - Each with icon, title, brief description
   - Bottom CTA: "Start Your AI Journey"

Use parallel Task agents to generate all 5 slides simultaneously.
Ensure consistent color usage and clean professional aesthetic across all slides.
⚠️ REMINDER: Never include "NotebookLM" text, logos, or branding in any generated slide.
```

### Best Practices for Multi-Slide Generation

**Do:**
- ✅ Define complete style spec before starting
- ✅ Use consistent hex codes (not "red", use "#d71920")
- ✅ Pre-plan all directory names
- ✅ Pass identical parameters to each agent
- ✅ Review and adjust after generation

**Don't:**
- ❌ Mix styles between slides (keep consistent)
- ❌ Forget to specify `use_lossless = True`
- ❌ Use vague color names ("blue" → specify "#005295")
- ❌ Generate too many at once (>5 risks inconsistency)
- ❌ Skip the review phase
